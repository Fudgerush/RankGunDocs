# RankGun Python Package

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ¤“">
A Python package is typically a collection of modules that are related to each other. When a module from an external package is required in a program, that package can be imported and its modules can be put to use. RankGun is a Python package that provides an API client for the RankGun API.
</Callout>

## Installation

To install RankGun, run the following command:

```cmd
pip install rankgun
```

After installing RankGun, you will be able to use its API client to interact with the RankGun API.

## API Client

The RankGun class is the main API client for the RankGun API. It takes two arguments: ``api_token`` & ``workspace_id``.

Which **are** required for authentication with the RankGun API.

### Methods

The ``RankGun`` class provides the following methods to interact with the RankGun API.

#### ``get_status()``

This method returns the status of the RankGun API.

```py
async def get_status(self):
    """Get the status of the RankGun API."""
    endpoint = "/status"
    return await self._get(endpoint)
```

This method promotes a user's rank by + 1.

#### ``promote()``

This method promotes a user's rank by +1.

```py
async def promote(self, username=None, User_Id=None):
    """Promote a user. +1 rank"""
    endpoint = "/ranking/promote"
    params = {"workspace_id": self.workspace_id}

    if username is not None:
        params["username"] = username
    elif User_Id is not None:
        params["user_id"] = User_Id
    return await self._post(endpoint, params=params)

```


#### ``demote()``

This method demotes a user's rank by - 1.

```py
async def demote(self, username=None, User_Id=None):
    """Demote a user. -1 Rank"""
    endpoint = "/ranking/demote"
    params = {"workspace_id": self.workspace_id}

    if username is not None:
        params["username"] = username
    elif User_Id is not None:
        params["user_id"] = User_Id
    return await self._post(endpoint, params=params)
```

#### ``setrank()``

This method sets the rank of a user to a specific value.

```py
async def setrank(self, rank, username=None, User_Id=None):
    """Set the rank of a user. * Rank"""
    endpoint = "/ranking/set-rank"
    params = {"workspace_id": self.workspace_id, "rank": rank}

    if username is not None:
        params["username"] = username
    elif User_Id is not None:
        params["user_id"] = User_Id
    return await self._post(endpoint, params=params)

```

#### ``exile(username=None, User_Id=None)``

This method removes a player from a group.

```py
async def exile(self, username=None, User_Id=None):
    """Removes players from group."""
    endpoint = "/ranking/exile"
    params = {"workspace_id": self.workspace_id}

    if username is not None:
        params["username"] = username
    elif User_Id is not None:
        params["user_id"]
```
